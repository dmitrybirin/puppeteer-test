# Pipedrive test

## Description

1. Create automated API and UI tests for “Add deal” feature in Pipedrive using JavaScript based testing framework.
2. The amount and scope of the tests is up to you to decide, just report how much time did you use to solve the task.

## Plan
- [x] Create Readme. That was easy:)
- [x] Choose UI framework -> Puppeteer
- [x] Get access/docs to API -> https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/
- [x] API framework -> https://www.frisbyjs.com/
- [x] Init frameworks (Puppeteer)
- [ ] Lint
- [ ] Write test cases
- [ ] Automate test cases
- [ ] Refactor and Polish
- [ ] Add how to run tests in Readme
- [ ] Create FAQ (Why puppeteer, pros and cons, why I did that, not that)
